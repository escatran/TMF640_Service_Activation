- Capitalizing entity names:
      response => Response, request => Request
- fixing type name to be aligned with central repository:
      RelatedParty => RelatedPartyRef
- renaming some entities to avoid too generic concepts which may be confusing when they will be integrated in the central repository
      Response => HttpResponse
      Request => HttpRequests
- Updating host and basePath to the tmforum standard ones
- Removing the "additionalproperties" from schemas
- replacing tool specific entity descriptions: "JSON Schema generated by XMLSpy v2016 rel. 2 (http://www.altova.com)"
- Replacing the inlined header anonym sub-object by an explicit entity definition called HeaderItem.
  This is a purely syntactic change but it is required because anonym sub-objects are not compaible with our UML representation conventions.
- Fixing typo error in entity name: NetworkFuction => NetworkEntity
- Removing the HEAD http operation as an api exposed operation since HEAD is not mentioned in TM Forum guidelines.
  TODO: Maybe should reconsider this
- Removing all the schemas already existing in central repository, except the ResourceSpecification;schema.json which was not found in central repository.


 Pending Questions:
 
 (1) This API exposes Service and Resource as resource with all operations GET,POST,PATCH,DELETE.
  Is this really want we want? What the link with Service Inventoty and Resource Inventory ??
  TODO: Consider removing these?
  
 (2) No notifications are currently defined. Should we add notifications for this API?
